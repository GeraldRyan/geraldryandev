# CSS

Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention.

CSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name. This allows you to use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about collisions.

This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS. CSS Module files can be imported anywhere in your application.
